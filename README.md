# Healthcare_Analysis
This repository holds my cancer diagnosis analysis project

# Purpose
As a person who wants to continuosly learn new skills and portray them, I decided to work on some healthcare data since I never have before. The dataset included on the patient such as the gender and age of the patient, the type of tumor, treatments options and their effectiveness

# Tools used
SparkSQL for analysis and aggregation
Pandas to export the results into separate dataframe
Matplotlib and seaborn to visualize some of the results
